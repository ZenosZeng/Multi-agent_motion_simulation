# Multi-agent_motion_simulation
This project is a useful tool to do motion simulation.

## Main files:
* Plotter - draw trajectory/animation/error
* Model - many classic agent types
* demos - run this

## how to use demos:
1. Define your basic simulation parameter and agent's type.
2. Define com/sense graph and formation shape.
3. Implement your controller.
4. set reference speed and orientaion, etc.

Motion data is saved as json file in /data.

## Currently supporting models:
- Single-Integrator
- Unicycle
- 3d Single-Integrator
